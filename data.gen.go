                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    ___

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

const license_AGPL_3_0_Short = `                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
`
const license_Artistic_2_0 = `Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.

Definitions
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
(i) the Original License or
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.

General Provisions
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.

(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.

(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.`

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License.

      d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
(or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license
rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder
without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license
fees, residuals or any other payments;

ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights,
common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING
OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN
IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License.

      d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

      e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society
(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions).

f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject
to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
(or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS

EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

      e. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing

such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties
for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,
You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear,
if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears,
then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation
to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor
will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise
Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,

or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however

license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions
as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed
here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect
to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
provisions that may appear in any communication from You.

e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome
Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution
4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar
Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the
Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,
and/or similar international agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your
use of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or

that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded,
as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

   a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and
You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority
to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

      5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

   b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through
a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

   a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a
URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes
no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of
the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation
of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply
to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor
or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License.

      d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known

All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally

You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms

remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any

private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary

Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder

AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN

5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who
created the Work.

d. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for

Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including
but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder.

b. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in
a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective
Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as
requested. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section
3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep

if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

      d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society
(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes
a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,

      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known

Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,
You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear,
if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears,
then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

      d. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties
for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise
of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial
as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member
of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License
that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
under Section 4(c).

e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation
to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor
will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise
Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions
as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome
Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

   Section 2 – Scope.

      a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial
purposes only; and

B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and
You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority
to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

         5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

      b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through
a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
than for NonCommercial purposes.



   Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

      a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

               ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

               iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;

B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
of any previous modifications; and

C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a
URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.



   Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.



   Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes
no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of
the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation
of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply
to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.



   Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

      d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.



   Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
and conditions of this Public License.



   Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor
or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License.

      d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested.

b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable)
of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied. Such
credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that

any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder
without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license
fees, residuals or any other payments;

common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING
OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN
IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will

survive any termination of this License.

perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed

credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
authorship credit.

      d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats,
but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited
to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as
requested.

b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or
(ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
(e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; and
to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if
any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear
where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least
as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

      d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society
(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,

intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified

to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing
fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram
in digital form or other electronic medium.

or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations
or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats,
but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but
not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must,
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)
if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another
party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms
of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;
(ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at
a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
of Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance
of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

      d. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties
for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise
of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial
as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member
of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License
that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
under Section 4(b).

e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort,
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which
would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not
have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome
Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives
4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the

receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.


   Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar
Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the
Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
relation with a moving image.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,
and/or similar international agreements.

d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your

e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

h. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial
advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the
exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright
and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial
provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
exchange.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways
that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded,
as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.



   Section 2 – Scope.

      a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial
purposes only; and

B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial
purposes only.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and
You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority
to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

         5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

      b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through
a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
than for NonCommercial purposes.



   Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

      a. Attribution.

         1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

               ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

               iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;

B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
of any previous modifications; and

C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License
to Share Adapted Material.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a
URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.



   Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share
Adapted Material;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.



   Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes
no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

   Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
and conditions of this Public License.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor
or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License.

      d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and You must

every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms

and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work
as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms
of this License.

c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

d. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
(or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license
rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder
without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license
fees, residuals or any other payments;

ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights,
common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING
OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN
IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

      e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society
(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication
to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including
signs, sounds or images.

j. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing
fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram
in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations
or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated
from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work
has been modified.";

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section
4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the
terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
(either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements
as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable
License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License
with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms
of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License
and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included
in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute
or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation
as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
License.

c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,
You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear,
if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears,
then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

      e. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties
for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise
of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial
as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member
of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License
that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
under Section 4(c).

f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation
to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor
will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise
Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions
as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome
Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the

making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

of the Adapter's License You apply.

or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

   b. Other rights.

Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through
a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
than for NonCommercial purposes.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes
no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of
the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation
of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply
to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
and conditions of this Public License.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor
or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
terms of this License.

      d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
of this License.

f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested.

b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable)
of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied. Such
credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where
any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license
rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder
without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license
fees, residuals or any other payments;

ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights,
common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING
OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN
IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement

the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions).

d. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to

of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,

control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms

a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,

perform the Work or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS

pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement
of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram
or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form
in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes
a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance
or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
License.

b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified
form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate
and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
(as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.

d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s)

individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case
of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
of this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression
including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture,
address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition
with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works
expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,

work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance;

as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer
to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
rights under this License despite a previous violation.

h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,
including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication
to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including
signs, sounds or images.

i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing
fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram
in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations
or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections.

      c. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties
for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats,
but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f),
all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must,
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)
if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another
party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms
of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;
(ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at
a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section
for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of
the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort,
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which
would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not
have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome
Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives
4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar
Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the
Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
relation with a moving image.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,
and/or similar international agreements.

d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your
use of the Licensed Material.

e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

h. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways
that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded,
as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

j. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

   a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

         B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and
You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority
to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

      5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

   b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through
a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

   a. Attribution.

      1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

of any previous modifications; and

C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public
License to Share Adapted Material.

3. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a
URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

4. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
the database, provided You do not Share Adapted Material;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes
no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of
the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation
of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply
to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor
or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,

Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include

perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms

remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any

perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work
as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms
of this License.

c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
(or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license
rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder
without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license
fees, residuals or any other payments;

common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,

consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed

transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
this License.

selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution,
ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

      e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society
(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions).

f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject
to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.

of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms
of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original
Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version
of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative
Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License
(e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in
the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer
to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative
Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License.

c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
(or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY

      e. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties
for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either
this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as
this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you
license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in
(i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms
of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You
must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every
copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not
offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;
(III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License
and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included
in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute
or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation
as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
License.

c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections,
You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear,
if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears,
then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation
to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor
will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise
Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions
as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make such provision valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
of the Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome
Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Public License.

c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses,
approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public
License.

d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,
and/or similar international agreements.

Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution
and ShareAlike.

h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the

Public License.

k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways
that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded,
as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

   a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and
You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority
to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

      5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient
of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions
of the Adapter's License You apply.

C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

   b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through
a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

   a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a
URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions
on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that
restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes
no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of
the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation
of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply
to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor
or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

- The Licensee or "You": any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence.
- Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.
2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence
The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work:

- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
- reproduce the Work,
- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work,
- distribute the Work or copies thereof,
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.
Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

3. Communication of the Source Code
The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

4. Limitations on copyright
Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

5. Obligations of the Licensee
The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence," refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

6. Chain of Authorship
The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or "bugs" inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is" basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

8. Disclaimer of Liability
Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

9. Additional agreements
While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.

10. Acceptance of the Licence
The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I agree" placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11. Information to the public
In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12. Termination of the Licence
The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous
Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.

14. Jurisdiction
Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.

15. Applicable Law
This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee;
- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.

                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    ___

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    ___ comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ` + "`" + `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type ` + "`" + `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  ` + "`" + `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    ___

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    ___
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ` + "`" + `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type ` + "`" + `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.`

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    ___

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library ` +
	"`" + `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    ___

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

const license_LGPL_3_0 = `                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.`

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date
The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

const license_OSL_3_0 = `This Open Software License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;

b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;

c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Open Software License;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the "Open Software License" or "OSL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.

   any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a
   distribution under section 1(c).

   (( 6) ))??
   Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
   Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the
   Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must
   cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
   prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that
   You have modified the Original Work.

   (( 7) ))??
   Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
   copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
   Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
   of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
   and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
   sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS"
   BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
   for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
   WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part
   of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License
   except under this disclaimer.

   (( 8) ))??
   Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
   Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
   the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
   of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
   apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

   (( 9) ))??
   Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this
   License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
   License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
   copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
   effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
   the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
   the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative
   Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms
   and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
   Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
   limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall
   terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
   granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in
   Section 1(c).

   (( 10) ))??
   Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and
   You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
   as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original
   Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an
   action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with
   other software or hardware.

   (( 11) ))??
   Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
   License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
   Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and
   under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
   Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
   subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
   appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 12) ))??
   Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
   seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
   recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
   attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
   any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 13) ))??
   Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
   such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable.

   (( 14) ))??
   Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
   in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising
   rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
   entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
   under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
   of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
   percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
   ownership of such entity.

((  AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 1, March 2002 ))??

Copyright © 2002 Affero Inc.

510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA

This license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright
(C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission.
Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of
Affero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
(Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This
General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
   terms of this Affero General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to
   any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
   Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
      thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
      Program is not required to print an announcement.)

      __1__ If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with users
      through a computer network and if, in the version you received, any user
      interacting with the Program was given the opportunity to request
      transmission to that user of the Program's complete source code, you must
      not remove that facility from your modified version of the Program or work
      based on the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all
      users interacting with your Program through a computer network to request
      immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your
      modified version or other derivative work.

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      __1__ Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties to this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero
   General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
   in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
   problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program
   does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
   ever published by Affero, Inc.

   You may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under
   any version of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License
   version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms
   and conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
   ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write
   to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
   the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
   software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the
community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in
alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become
available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software
are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case
of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU
General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public
access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that,
in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It
requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public
use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
access to the source code of the modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license,
not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the
Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   __1__ Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
   individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
   or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
   Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
   activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
   displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there
   is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
   criterion.

   __1__ Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
   defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
   specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used
   among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
   work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
   Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
   to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
   Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in
   source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
   essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
   operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler
   used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
   object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
   For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
   between those

   subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   __1__ Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
   License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
   This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
   provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
   conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
   covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
   those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
   conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
   with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

   __1__ Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
   restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   __1__ Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
   that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
   apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
   and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   __1__ Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
      and giving a relevant date.

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
      notices".

      __1__ You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      __1__ If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
      not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
   and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion
   of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
   other parts of the aggregate.

   __1__ Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
   4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
   Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
      for software interchange.

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
      possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source
      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a
      price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
      network server at no charge.

      __1__ Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
      allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
      the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      __1__ Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
      Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You
      need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with
      the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or
      a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
      needed to satisfy these requirements.

      __1__ Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
      6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
   conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
   personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
   purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
   In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall
   be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
   particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
   class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
   way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to
   use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
   product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless
   such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
   transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
   how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed
   under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But
   this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains
   the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
   the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
   communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
   with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
   require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   __1__ Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
   additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
   you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
   by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
   copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      __1__ Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      __1__ Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or

      __1__ Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
      ways as different from the original version; or

      __1__ Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

      __1__ Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
      names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      __1__ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
      by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
      authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
   by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may
   remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but
   permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered
   work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that
   the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
   apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
   terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
   apply either way.

   __1__ Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
   qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   __1__ Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
   of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
   consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise
   does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants
   you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
   or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License
   to do so.

   __1__ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
   third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
   from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
   with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
   portion of it.

   __1__ Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with
   the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
   of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to s ue for
   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to
   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
   party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
   charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or
   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
   extend the patent

   license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual
   knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
   in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would
   infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
   reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
   this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
   arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
   of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
   grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
   discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered
   work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for
   and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
   covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
   license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

   __1__ No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work
   so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may

   not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
   collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
   Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
   would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   __1__ Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
   Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
   with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
   interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your
   version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server
   at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
   copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the
   Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General
   Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
   link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
   GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
   resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
   which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain
   governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   __1__ Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any
   later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
   not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you
   may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
   GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
   of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version
   for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   __1__ Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   __1__ Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
   DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   __1__ Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
   shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of
   all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
   assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a
   fee.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

__30__

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along
with this program. If not, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network,
you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.
For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a
"Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways
you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different
programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>. ))??

(( ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 1.0 ))??

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE
("LICENSE"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE AND ITS TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT
SUCH RECIPIENT READS THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. "LICENSED WORK" AND "RECIPIENT"
ARE DEFINED BELOW.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This License is "adaptive", and the generic version or another
version of an Adaptive Public License should not be relied upon to determine
your rights and obligations under this License. You must read the specific
Adaptive Public License that you receive with the Licensed Work, as certain
terms are defined at the outset by the Initial Contributor.

See Section 2.2 below, Exhibit A attached, and any Suppfile.txt accompanying
this License to determine the specific adaptive features applicable to this
License. For example, without limiting the foregoing, (a) for selected choice of
law and jurisdiction see Part 3 of Exhibit A; (b) for the selected definition of
Third Party see Part 4 of Exhibit A; and (c) for selected patent licensing terms
(if any) see Section 2.2 below and Part 6 of Exhibit A.

      "INDEPENDENT MODULE" means a separate module of software and/or data that
      is not a derivative work of or copied from the Licensed Work or any
      portion thereof. In addition, a module does not qualify as an Independent
      Module but instead forms part of the Licensed Work if the module: (a) is
      embedded in the Licensed Work; (b) is included by reference in the
      Licensed Work other than by a function call or a class reference; or (c)
      must be included or contained, in whole or in part, within a file
      directory or subdirectory actually containing files making up the Licensed
      Work.

      (( 1.8. ))??
      "INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR" means the Person or entity identified as the Initial
      Contributor in the notice required by Part 1 of Exhibit A.

      and/or additions to:

         (( (a) ))??
         the Initial Work;

         (( (b) ))??
         any other Subsequent Work; or

         (( c ))??
         to any combination of the Initial Work and any such other Subsequent
         Work;

         where such changes and/or additions originate from a Subsequent
         Contributor. A Subsequent Work will "originate" from a Subsequent
         Contributor if the Subsequent Work was a result of efforts by such
         Subsequent Contributor (or anyone acting on such Subsequent
         Contributor's behalf, such as, a contractor or other entity that is
         engaged by or under the direction of the Subsequent Contributor). For
         greater certainty, a Subsequent Work expressly excludes and shall not
         capture within its meaning any Independent Module.

      (( 1.19. ))??
      "SUPPLEMENT FILE" means a file distributed with the Licensed Work having a

         Subject to the terms of this License, the Initial Contributor hereby
         grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
         copyright license to:

            (( (i) ))??
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
            perform, distribute and sublicense the Initial Work; and

            (( (ii) ))??
            reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and
            sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;

            in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications,
            on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.

         (( (b) ))??
         Subject to the terms of this License, each Subsequent Contributor
         hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
         copyright license to:

            (( (i) ))??
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
            perform, distribute and sublicense the Subsequent Work of such
            Subsequent Contributor; and

            (( (ii) ))??
            reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and
            sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;

            in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications,
            on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.

      (( 2.2. ))??
      PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.

         (( (a) ))??
         This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever
         from the Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any
         Distributor unless, at the time the Initial Work is first distributed
         or made available under this License (as the case may be), the Initial
         Contributor has selected pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent
         terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. If this
         is not done then the Initial Work and any other Subsequent Work is made
         available under the License without any patent license (the
         "PATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE").

         (( (b) ))??
         However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make
         available (as the case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work;
         or (2) any Licensed Work distributed by the Initial Contributor which
         includes the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) and/or any
         Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a License
         which includes a patent license (the "PATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE") by
         selecting pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in
         paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A, when the Initial
         Contributor distributes or makes available (as the case may be) such
         future copies under this License.

         (( c ))??
         If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial
         Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under the
         Patents-Included License, then all licensing of such copies under this
         License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from
         Part 6 of Exhibit A and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon
         the Patents-Excluded License for any such copies. However, all
         Recipients that receive one or more copies of the Initial Work or any
         other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the License which
         includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with
         respect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and
         availability and distribution of such copies, including Modifications
         made by such Recipient to such copies, shall be under a copy of the
         License without any patent license.

         (( (d) ))??
         Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the
         Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License
         having a Patents-Excluded License with any copy of the Licensed Work
         (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a
         Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof)
         shall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or
         distributes the combination (as the case may be), be subject to only
         the terms of the License having the Patents-Included License which
         shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of
         Exhibit A.

      (( 2.3. ))??
      ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER.

      Recipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and
      each Subsequent Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
      forth herein, no representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is
      provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or
      Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor,
      Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to
      Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
      intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed
      Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
      hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any
      other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without
      limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is
      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is
      Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Licensed Work.

      (( 2.4. ))??
      RESERVATION.

      Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,
      copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of
      Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor except as
      expressly stated herein.

   (( 3. ))??
   DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY.

         (( (a) ))??
         A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor's
         Subsequent Work(s) available to the public via an Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism for a period of at least twelve (12) months. The
         aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a reasonable time
         after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60)
         days after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor's
         Subsequent Work.

         (( (b) ))??
         All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with
         the terms of the License, and must include a copy of this License
         (including without limitation Exhibit A and the accompanying Supplement
         File) with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed. In particular,
         this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed Work in
         a file called "license.txt." In addition, the License Notice in Part 5
         of Exhibit A must be included at the beginning of all Source Code
         files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the License
         Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the
         Licensed Work.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK.

      A Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion
      thereof, in Executable form (an "EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION") to any third
      party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the
      Executable Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy
      of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the following conditions is
      fulfilled:

         (( (a) ))??
         The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for
         the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source
         Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable
         Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or

         (( (b) ))??
         The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer,
         valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party
         under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of
         physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
         copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable
         Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain
         available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution
         Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as
         a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months.

      For greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed
      Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form,
      whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work
      or Independent Modules, or in some other combination.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS.

      When a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof,
      available to any Person in Source Code form, it must be made available
      under this License and a copy of this License must be included with each
      copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy of the License is
      conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater
      clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the
      Licensed Work in any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for
      the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more
      than the cost of physically performing source distribution.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE.

      Each Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5
      of Exhibit A is included in each file of the Source Code for each
      Subsequent Work originating from that particular Subsequent Contributor,
      if such notice is not already included in each such file. If it is not
      possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
      structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a
      location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where
      a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS.

      Notwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally
      within its own corporation or organization use the Licensed Work,
      including the Initial Work and Subsequent Works, and make Modifications
      for internal use within Recipient's own corporation or organization
      (collectively, "INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS"). The Recipient shall have no
      obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any
      such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such
      internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All
      Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a
      Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the
      terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to distribute any such
      Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be
      deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications
      distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work
      originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first
      such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be
      distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the
      terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      INDEPENDENT MODULES.

      This License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial
      Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and
      such Independent Modules may be licensed or made available under one or
      more separate license agreements.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      LARGER WORKS.

      Any Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by
      combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the
      terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more
      products. However, in any such case, Distributor or Recipient (as the case
      may be) must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled
      for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work.

      (( 3.8. ))??
      DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS.

         (( (a) ))??
         Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where
         the Initial Contributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor)
         must cause each Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that
         Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in
         accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Supplement File, that
         such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution to
         that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements
         are set out in Part 1 of the Supplement File, then there are no
         requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they
         make resulting in Subsequent Works.

         (( (b) ))??
         The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add
         to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the "EARLIER
         DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS") for documenting changes resulting in
         Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File
         distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the
         Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the "NEW
         DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS") for documenting such changes.

         (( c ))??
         Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any
         Subsequent Work under a copy of this License (in each case, an "Earlier
         LICENSED COPY") having the Earlier Description Requirements may choose,
         with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to comply with the
         Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements.
         Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description
         Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any
         copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File
         having a section entitled Part 1 that contains a copy of the New
         Description Requirements.

         (( (d) ))??
         For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is
         to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must
         document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in
         Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement File shall not be used to
         increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of
         this License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and
         obligations of any Recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis
         for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can be required to
         correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1
         of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of
         any Supplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed
         Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting
         changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work.

         (( (e) ))??
         An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and
         contributions made by Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of
         Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is a sample only and is not binding
         on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of this
         Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor
         includes in Part 1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the
         Initial Work distributed under this License.

      (( 3.9. ))??
      USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME.

      The name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to
      endorse or promote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed
      Work, without prior written permission.

      (( 3.10. ))??
      LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR.

         (( (a) ))??
         As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that
         its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort
         invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may
         include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each time
         an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent
         Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent
         display of the Initial Contributor's attribution information must occur
         (the "ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION"). The Attribution Information must be
         included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater
         certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File
         that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable
         program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not
         a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably
         modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require
         Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution
         Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial
         Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one
         digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL
         (collectively, the "ATTRIBUTION LIMITS").

         (( (b) ))??
         If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out
         in Part 2 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for
         Recipients to display any Attribution Information of the Initial
         Contributor.

         (( c ))??
         Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or
         trade names contained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed
         with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial
         Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial
         Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as
         expressly set out in this License.

      (( 3.11. ))??
      For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained
      within a Supplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the
      description or attribution requirements, as the case may be. Any provision
      in a Supplement File that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or
      amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be
      deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY.

      (( 4.1. ))??
      COMMERCIAL SERVICES.

      A Recipient ("COMMERCIAL RECIPIENT") may choose to offer, and to charge a
      fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
      (collectively, "SERVICES") to one or more other Recipients or
      Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may do so only on that
      Commercial Recipient's own behalf, and not on behalf of any other
      Distributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than
      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is/are
      offered by Commercial Recipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient
      use any Services to deny any party the Licensed Work in Source Code or
      Executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this
      License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish any of
      the other terms of this License, including without limitation the
      obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing
      any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such
      distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more
      than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable
      distribution (as the case may be).

      (( 4.2. ))??
      INDEMNITY.

      Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
      with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
      License is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Licensed Work,
      the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed Work in a commercial
      product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
      liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the
      Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services,
      such Distributor ("COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR") hereby agrees to defend and
      indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case
      an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") against any losses, damages and costs
      (collectively "LOSSES") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
      actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the
      extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in
      connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a
      commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The
      obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating
      to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to
      qualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial
      Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial
      Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor in,
      the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party
      may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   (( 5. ))??
   VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

      (( 5.1. ))??
      NEW VERSIONS.

      The Initial Contributor may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
      version number.

      (( 5.2. ))??
      EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS.

      Once the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by
      Initial Contributor under a particular version of the License, Recipient
      may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version. However,
      if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any
      subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor,
      then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with
      the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further
      reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public
      performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the Recipient in
      connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than the Initial
      Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed
      Work

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      GENERAL DISCLAIMER.

      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK IS
      PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY

      CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
      THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT. SHOULD ANY LICENSED WORK PROVE
      DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, RECIPIENT (NOT THE INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR OR ANY
      SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUMES THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
      REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
      LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER

      (( 6.2. ))??
      RESPONSIBILITY OF RECIPIENTS.

      of using and distributing the Licensed Work and assumes all risks
      associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but
      not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
      applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
      unavailability or interruption of operations.

      express terms herein.

      (( 7.2. ))??
      Recipient may choose to terminate this License automatically at any time.

      (( 7.3. ))??
      This License, including without limitation the rights granted hereunder to
      a particular Recipient, will terminate automatically if such Recipient is
      in material breach of any of the terms of this License and fails to cure
      such breach within sixty (60) days of becoming aware of the breach.
      Without limiting the foregoing, any material breach by such Recipient of
      any term of any other License under which such Recipient is granted any
      rights to the Licensed Work shall constitute a material breach of this
      License.

      (( 7.4. ))??
      Upon termination of this License by or with respect to a particular
      Recipient for any reason, all rights granted hereunder and under any other
      License to that Recipient shall terminate. However, all sublicenses to the
      Licensed Work which were previously properly granted by such Recipient
      under a copy of this License (in each case, an "Other License" and in
      plural, "Other Licenses") shall survive any such termination of this
      License, including without limitation the rights and obligations under
      such Other Licenses as set out in their respective Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
      7 and 8, mutatis mutandis, for so long as the respective sublicensees
      (i.e. other Recipients) remain in compliance with the terms of the copy of
      this License under which such sublicensees received rights to the Licensed
      Work. Any termination of such Other Licenses shall be pursuant to their
      respective Section 7, mutatis mutandis. Provisions which, by their nature,
      must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
      survive.

      (( 7.5. ))??
      Upon any termination of this License by or with respect to a particular
      Recipient, Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, and 8.2, together
      with all provisions of this License necessary for the interpretation and
      enforcement of same, shall expressly survive such termination.

      IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR
      AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,

      (( 9.1. ))??
      This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
      laws of the Governing Jurisdiction assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A,
      without regard to its conflict of law provisions. No party may bring a
      legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of the
      action arose. Each party waives its rights (if any) to a jury trial in any
      litigation arising under this License. Note that if the Governing
      Jurisdiction is not assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, then the Governing
      Jurisdiction shall be the State of New York.

      (( 9.2. ))??
      The courts of the Governing Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction, but not
      exclusive jurisdiction, to entertain and determine all disputes and
      claims, whether for specific performance, injunction, damages or
      otherwise, both at law and in equity, arising out of or in any way
      relating to this License, including without limitation, the legality,

      technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or
      distribute.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this
      License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any

      a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this
      License.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

   SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF
   SECTIONS 8 AND 9, APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO
   AS "APPLE") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR
   CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE DOES NOT

   REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE
   UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR- FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE
   CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN
   APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY
   INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Original Code
   is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
   navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which
   case the failure of the Original Code could lead to death, personal injury,
   or severe physical or environmental damage.

   (( 9. ))??
   Liability.

      (( 9.1 ))??
      Infringement. If any portion of, or functionality implemented by, the
      Original Code becomes the subject of a claim of infringement, Apple may,
      at its option: (a) attempt to procure the rights necessary for Apple and
      You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b) modify the Affected
      Original Code so that it is no longer infringing; or (c) suspend Your
      rights to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense and distribute the Affected
      Original Code until a final determination of the claim is made by a court
      or governmental administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and Apple
      lifts the suspension as set forth below. Such suspension of rights will be
      effective immediately upon Apple's posting of a notice to such effect on
      the Apple web site that is used for implementation of this License. Upon
      such final determination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the
      payment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction, modification,
      sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original Code, Apple will
      lift the suspension of rights to the Affected Original Code by posting a
      notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for
      implementation of this License. If Apple suspends Your rights to Affected
      Original Code, nothing in this License shall be construed to restrict You,
      at Your option and subject to applicable law, from replacing the Affected
      Original Code with non-infringing code or independently negotiating for
      necessary rights from such third party.

      (( 9.2 ))??
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR
      ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
      OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL
      CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT,
      WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE,
      EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND
      NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no
      event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages under this
      License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   (( 10. ))??
   Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or
   trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X", "Mac OS X Server" or any
   other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple
   Marks") and no Apple Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived
   from the Original Code other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at
   all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are
   posted at http:/www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

   (( 11. ))??
   Ownership. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the
   Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple
   Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically
   subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license
   such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
   contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. Apple's
   development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution
   of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate:

         (( (a) ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
         term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
         becoming aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         13.5(b); or

         (( c ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
         term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
         against Apple.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in
      your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have
      been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
      of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in
      effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but
      not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. Neither party
      will be liable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any
      sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of either party.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 13.1 ))??
      Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
      in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
      Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
      defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical
      data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
      Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense
      purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
      227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
      Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between You and Apple, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether
      expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right
      to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
      distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works,
      technology or products that You may

      develop, produce, market or distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this
      License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any
      other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
      a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this
      License.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient
      rediges en anglais.

         they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
         Original Code that refer to this License; and

         (( (b) ))??
         You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code
         of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer
         or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this
         License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under
         Section 6.

      (( 2.2 ))??
      You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code,
      provided that in each instance:

         (( (a) ))??
         You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the
         Source Code of the Covered Code;

         (( (b) ))??
         You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice
         in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications,
         and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
         You changed the files and the date of any change;

         (( c ))??
         You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly
         available under the terms of this License, including the license grants
         set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered
         Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment,
         whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code
         of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web
         site); and

         (( (d) ))??
         if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You

         available under the terms of this License with information on how and
         where to obtain such Source Code.

      (( 2.3 ))??
      You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each
      Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the
      Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any
      Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each
      Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
      license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is
      Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Covered Code.

   (( 3. ))??
   Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
   to You under this License:

      (( (a) ))??

      royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other
      intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by

      distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through multiple tiers of
      distribution.

   (( 4. ))??

   Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure
   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any
   portion thereof.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no
   other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.
   Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
   Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

   (( 6. ))??
   Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent
   with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or

   behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any
   Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
   Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,
   defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of
   any such Additional Terms.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of
   this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
   version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular
   version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
   version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any
   subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than
   Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
   under this License.

   (( 8. ))??
   NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
   pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may
   contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be
   incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
   use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire
   risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR
   SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED
   TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS
   EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY
   RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH
   YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE
   COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED
   CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE
   WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE,
   AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A
   WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in
   the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
   systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the
   Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
   environmental damage.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
   SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE
   OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF,
   WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
   PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
   ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to
   You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
   this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   (( 10. ))??
   Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or
   trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X", "Mac OS X Server",
   "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks or trade
   names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark or
   trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Apple Marks may be used to
   endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as
   permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party
   trademark usage guidelines which are posted at

   Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
   Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and

   not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole
   discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or
   on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to
   license them at all.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate:

         (( (a) ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
         term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
         becoming aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         13.5(b); or

         (( c ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
         term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
         against Apple.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in
      your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have
      been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination
      of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in
      effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but
      not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be
      liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort
      solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of any party.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 13.1 ))??
      Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
      in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
      Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
      defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical
      data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
      Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense
      purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
      227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software

      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between or amongYou, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent
      to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or
      otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right
      to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
      distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works,
      technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or
      distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any
      provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future
      enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter will not apply to this License.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient
      rédigés en anglais.

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple
      and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by

      otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
      hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it
      is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Covered Code.

   (( 3. ))??
   Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted
   to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving
   or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive,

   Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or

   other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
   Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure
   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any
   portion thereof.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no
   other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.
   Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
   Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

   (( 6. ))??
   Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent
   with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or
   more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
   behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any
   Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
   Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,
   defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of
   any such Additional Terms.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of

   version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular
   version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that

   pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may
   contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be
   incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
   use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire

   COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED
   CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE

   AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A
   WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in
   the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
   systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the
   Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
   environmental damage.

   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
   SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,

   PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
   ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to
   You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
   this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   (( 10. ))??
   Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or
   trade names "Apple",
   ((Apple Computer))??
   "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming
   Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names
   belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service
   mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use

   Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original
   Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all
   times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
   http:/www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

   (( 11. ))??
   Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
   Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
   Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and
   interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on
   behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will
   not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole
   discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or
   on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to
   license them at all.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination.

      (( 12.1 ))??
      Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate:

         (( (a) ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
         term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
         becoming aware of such breach;

         (( (b) ))??
         immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
         13.5(b); or

         (( c ))??
         automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
         term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
         against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for
         patent infringement against You in that instance.

      (( 12.2 ))??
      Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any
      further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
      the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been
      properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not
      limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be
      liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort
      solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its
      terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any
      other right or remedy of any party.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous.

      (( 13.1 ))??
      Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
      in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
      Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as
      defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical
      data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical
      Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense
      purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and
      227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
      Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
      Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      (( 13.2 ))??
      Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an
      agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
      between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent
      to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or
      otherwise.

      (( 13.3 ))??
      Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right
      to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
      distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar
      functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works,
      technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or
      distribute.

      (( 13.4 ))??
      Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any
      provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future
      enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter will not apply to this License.

      (( 13.5 ))??
      Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
      finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be
      unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the
      maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
      intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in
      full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable
      law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying
      with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those
      Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately
      discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that
      are in your possession or control.

      (( 13.6 ))??
      Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You
      and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
      District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
      jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
      District with respect to this License. The application of the United
      Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
      expressly excluded.

      (( 13.7 ))??
      Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
      This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
      State of California, except that body of California law concerning
      conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
      clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that
      this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties
      ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient
      rédigés en anglais.

((Copyright __20__))??

(( NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by
the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those
of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this
license with extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this License
to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above notices
and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except
for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description
of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity
that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied to a
work created in a country other than the United States, replacing the first
paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of the
appropriate country. ))??

   (( 0. ))??
   Subject Matter

   This License applies to the computer program known as "Aladdin Ghostscript."
   The "Program", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted
   work whose copyright is held by Aladdin Enterprises (the "Licensor"). Please
   note that Aladdin Ghostscript is neither the program known as "GNU
   Ghostscript" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial
   licensing from Artifex Software Inc.

   A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
   of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such
   as a translation or a modification.

   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM),
   YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND
   CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED
   ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR
   DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED
   BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR
   DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

   (( 1. ))??
   Licenses.

   Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply
   with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further,
   that you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:

      (( (a) ))??
      You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the
      Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any
      medium.

      (( (b) ))??
      You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
      distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

   (( 2. ))??
   Restrictions.

   This license is subject to the following restrictions:

      (( (a) ))??
      Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a
      commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is
      made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment
      for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service
      related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that
      includes a copy of the Program "without charge"; these are only examples,
      and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following
      methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves
      be a violation of this restriction:

         (( (i) ))??
         Posting the Program on a public access information storage and
         retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving
         information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not
         content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the
         same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access
         to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other
         product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under
         this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and
         that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an
         exhaustive enumeration.)

         (( (ii) ))??
         Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided
         that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and
         verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be
         redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that
         such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying
         documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of
         such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media.
         (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a
         distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included
         in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)

      (( (b) ))??
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the
      Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope.
      Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output
      produced through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if
      its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
      been made by running the Program).

      (( c ))??
      You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work
      that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is
      derived from the Program or any part thereof ("the Work"):

         (( (i) ))??
         If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry
         prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program's files
         and the date of any change. In each source file that you have modified,
         you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file,
         including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and
         purpose of the change;

         (( (ii) ))??
         You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to
         all third parties under the terms of this License;

         (( (iii) ))??
         If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
         cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or
         display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
         notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
         warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the
         Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to
         view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if
         the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an
         announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an "About box",
         the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same
         circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not
         normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print
         an announcement.);

         (( (iv) ))??
         You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding
         machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used
         for software interchange. The source code for a work means the
         preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
         executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all
         modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
         plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
         executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is
         normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
         components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
         which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of
         that component if you have it and are allowed to do so;

         (( (v) ))??
         If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work,
         such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a
         prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License
         and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the
         License on the distribution medium;

         (( (vi) ))??
         You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise
         of the rights granted herein.

         If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the
         equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering
         equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts
         as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
         compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.

   (( 3. ))??
   Reservation of Rights.

   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein.
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
   sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   (( 4. ))??
   Other Restrictions.

   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
   permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
   License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
   License.

   (( 5. ))??
   Limitations.

   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
   LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
   PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
   REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
   AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
   DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 6. ))??
   General.

   This License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A.,
   excluding choice of law rules.

   If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that
   part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law,
   and no other parts of the License shall be affected.

   For United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED
   RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are
   acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply:

   If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the Program and
   its documentation are classified as "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation" respectively and, pursuant to
   DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its
   documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or
   agency is other than DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified as
   "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
   documentation" respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the
   Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with

((Aladdin Free Public License (Version 9, September 18, 2000)
((Copyright __10__ Aladdin Enterprises, Menlo Park, California, U.S.A. All Rights Reserved.))??
))??


((  NOTE: This License is
not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free Software
Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the GNU
Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license
with extra care.))??

   Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply
   this License to their own work, as long as the entire License
   (including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no
   changes, additions, or deletions except for changing the first
   paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work
   to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that
   holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied
   to a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing
   the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the
   laws of the appropriate country.

   This License is not an Open Source license: among other things, it
   places restrictions on distribution of the Program, specifically
   including sale of the Program. While Aladdin Enterprises respects and
   supports the philosophy of the Open Source Definition, and shares the
   desire of the GNU project to keep licensed software freely
   redistributable in both source and object form, we feel that Open
   Source licenses unfairly prevent developers of useful software from
   being compensated proportionately when others profit financially from
   their work. This License attempts to ensure that those who receive,
   redistribute, and contribute to the licensed Program according to the
   Open Source and Free Software philosophies have the right to do so,
   while retaining for the developer(s) of the Program the power to make
   those who use the Program to enhance the value of commercial products
   pay for the privilege of doing so.

0. Subject Matter

   This License applies to the computer program known as "AFPL
   Ghostscript." The "Program", below, refers to such program. The
   Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by artofcode
   LLC, located in Benicia, California (the "Licensor"). Please note that
   AFPL Ghostscript is neither the program known as "GNU Ghostscript" nor
   the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from
   Artifex Software Inc.

   A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
   derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States
   Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.

   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE
   PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND
   ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING
   THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE
   GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS
   DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT
   ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE
   PROGRAM.

1. Licenses.

   Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you
   comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and
   provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this
   License with the Program:
   (a)
          You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of
          the Program's source code as you receive it throughout the
          world, in any medium.
   (b)
          You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program
          and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any
          medium.

2. Restrictions.

   This license is subject to the following restrictions:
   (a)
          Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by
          a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if
          any payment is made in connection with such distribution,
          whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or
          indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the
          Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a
          copy of the Program "without charge"; these are only examples,
          and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities).
          The following methods of distribution involving payment shall
          not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:
        (i)
               Posting the Program on a public access information storage
               and retrieval service for which a fee is received for
               retrieving information (such as an on-line service),
               provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the
               fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of
               information consisting of random data) and that access to
               the service and to the Program is available independent of
               any other product or service. An example of a service that
               does not fall under this section is an on-line service
               that is operated by a company and that is only available
               to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive
               enumeration.)
        (ii)
               Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable
               media, provided that the files containing the Program are
               reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all
               information on such media be redistributable for
               non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such
               media are distributed by themselves (except for
               accompanying documentation) independent of any other
               product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM,
               magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not
               intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a
               distribution that does not fall under this section is a
               CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an
               exhaustive enumeration.)
   (b)
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of
          the Program are not subject to this License and they are
          outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is
          not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the
          Program is subject to this license only if its contents
          constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
          been made by running the Program).
   (c)
          You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to
          any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in
          part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
          thereof ("the Work"):
        (i)
               If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work
               to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified
               the Program's files and the date of any change. In each
               source file that you have modified, you must include a
               prominent notice that you have modified the file,
               including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the
               date and purpose of the change;
        (ii)
               You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at
               no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
               License;
        (iii)
               If the Work normally reads commands interactively when
               run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences
               operation, to print or display an announcement including
               an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
               no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty).
               Such notice must also state that users may redistribute
               the Work only under the conditions of this License and
               tell the user how to view the copy of this License
               included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is
               interactive but normally prints or displays such an
               announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an
               "About box", the Work is required to print or display the
               notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program
               itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
               announcement, the Work is not required to print an
               announcement.);
        (iv)
               You must accompany the Work with the complete
               corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a
               medium customarily used for software interchange. The
               source code for a work means the preferred form of the
               work for making modifications to it. For an executable
               work, complete source code means all the source code for
               all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
               definition files, plus the scripts used to control
               compilation and installation of the executable code. If
               you distribute with the Work any component that is
               normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
               with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
               the operating system on which the executable runs, you
               must also distribute the source code of that component if
               you have it and are allowed to do so;
        (v)
               If you distribute any written or printed material at all
               with the Work, such material must include either a written
               copy of this License, or a prominent written indication
               that the Work is covered by this License and written
               instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of
               the License on the distribution medium;
        (vi)
               You may not impose any further restrictions on the
               recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the
   equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering
   equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts
   as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.

  3. Reservation of Rights.

   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth
   herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
   Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
   this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

  4. Other Restrictions.

   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
   distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.

  5. Limitations.

   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
   NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.
   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
   WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
   ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
   NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
   LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
   TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
   PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  6. General.

   This License is governed by the laws of the State of California,
   U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.

   If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,
   that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with
   the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.

   For United States Government users, the Program is provided with
   RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States
   Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency,
   the following apply:

     If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the
     Program and its documentation are classified as "commercial
     computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation"
     respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government
     is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with
     the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD,
     the Program and its documentation are classified as "commercial
     computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation"
     respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is
     acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the
     terms of this License.

      form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice
      that is included in or attached to the work
      (( (an example is provided in the Appendix below). ))??

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
      that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
      revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as
      a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
      Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
      merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
      Derivative Works thereof.

      mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
      that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of
      discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is
      conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
      owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
      behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   (( 2. ))??
   Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
   Object form.

   (( 3. ))??
   Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
   patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
   otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent
   claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

      modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      (( b) ))??
      use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      (( c) ))??
      rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
      standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
      manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
      differs from the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
      with your modifications.

      (( c) ))??
      accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
      Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard

   charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this
   Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a
   larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
   advertise this Package as a product of your own.

   (( 6. ))??
   The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
   the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
   this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
   commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

   (( 7. ))??
   C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
   be considered part of this Package.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may
be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the
Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that
Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free
software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you
should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.

Definitions

   "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
   copyright notice for the entire Package.

   "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to
   the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

   "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
   modify the Package.

   "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
   and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may
   consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

   "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to
   anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside
   of your company or organization.

   "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package
   or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean
   licensing fees.

   "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
   been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

   "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
   changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

   "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
   Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
   modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

   "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration
   files for the Package.

   "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
   other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the
   Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

   (( (1) ))??

   Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not
   Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

   (( (2) ))??
   You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version
   of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a
   Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright
   notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies
   may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

   (( (3) ))??
   You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications
   made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be
   considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original
   License.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

   (( (4) ))??
   You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a
   Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)
   provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version,
   including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features,
   executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
   following:

      (( (a) ))??
      make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
      Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder
      may include your modifications in the Standard Version.

      (( (b) ))??
      ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
      user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified
      Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard
      Version.

      (( c ))??
      allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
      Source form of the Modified Version available to others under

         (( (i) ))??

         (( (ii) ))??
         a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
         redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
         apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
         Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
         be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
         Distributor Fees are allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
without the Source

   (( (5) ))??
   You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source,
   provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of
   the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your
   distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out
   such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on
   demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or
   cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the
   instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under
   this license.

   (( (6) ))??
   You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,
   provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the
   Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package

   (( (7) ))??
   You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
   Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation
   provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor
   Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the
   aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and
   Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the
   aggregation.

   (( (8) ))??
   You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to
   embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone
   binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and
   Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not
   expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

   (( (9) ))??
   Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend
   or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a
   Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the
   Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.

General Provisions

   (( (10) ))??
   Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
   is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the
   Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the
   Package, if you do not accept this license.

   (( (11) ))??
   If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by
   someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your
   Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

   (( (12) ))??
   This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark,
   tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

   (( (13) ))??
   This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent
   license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
   transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the
   Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you
   institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against
   any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
   infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date
   that such litigation is filed.

   (( (14) ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty:

   THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND
   WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE

   NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,

(( BitTorrent Open Source License

Version 1.0 ))??

This BitTorrent Open Source License (the "License") applies to the BitTorrent
client and related software products as well as any updates or maintenance
releases of that software ("BitTorrent Products") that are distributed by
BitTorrent, Inc. ("Licensor"). Any BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this
License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected
by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may
use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.

Preamble

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of
this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal
effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not
this Preamble.

This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the
Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the "JOSL"), which has been approved by Open
Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been dropped.

This License provides that:

   (( 1. ))??
   You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component
   of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several
   different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.

   (( 2. ))??
   Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including
   Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The
   terms "Licensed Product," "Modifications," "Contributors" and "Source Code"
   are defined in the License.)

   (( 3. ))??
   You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can
   create Derivative Works from it. (The term "Derivative Works" is defined in
   the License.)

   (( 4. ))??
   By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you
   agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then
   distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you
   must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not
   providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
   liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or
   causes you any injury or damages.

   (( 6. ))??
   If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge
   fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability
   obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.

   (( 7. ))??
   If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed
   Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the
   Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.

You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case
the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they
do to the original Licensed Product.

Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice.
If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to
fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to
publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that
consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.

New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose
to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those
from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the
License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.

This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are
defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your
convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.

License Terms

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
   property claims, to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any
      Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both
      Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or
      as part of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 2. ))??
   Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. "Modifications" means any
   additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file
   containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of
   Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term "Licensed Product"
   shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any
   Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each
   person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and
   distributed, a Modification (a "Contributor") hereby grants you a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
   property claims, to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any
      Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both
      Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or
      as part of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 3. ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
   grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
   other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as
   expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the
   Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for
   combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No
   right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
   such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License
   shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different
   terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right
   to license.

   (( 4. ))??
   Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.

      (( a. ))??
      Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition
      for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any
      Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you
      distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without
      limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you
      contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
      future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include
      a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you
      distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter
      or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
      rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering
      the additional rights described in Section 4(d).

      (( b. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of
      this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any
      Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you
      distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a
      mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the
      electronic transfer of data (an "Electronic Distribution Mechanism"). The
      Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you
      distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the
      date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
      subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made
      available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( c. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( i. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third
         party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights
         granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source
         Code distribution titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any
         Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall
         promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been
         obtained.

         (( ii. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application
         programming interface ("API") and you have knowledge of patent licenses
         that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( iii. ))??
         Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to
         4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are
         your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant
         the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( d. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you
      provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to
      which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe
      recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the
      notice contained in Exhibit A (the "Notice") in each file of the Source
      Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a
      Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it
      is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to
      its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
      notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed
      Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf
      of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you
      alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor
      as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.

      (( e. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product
      as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain
      terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the
      requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that distribution, (ii) you
      include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related
      documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code
      version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms
      that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or
      any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as
      a result of any terms you offer.

      (( f. ))??
      Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g.,
      combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and
      distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you
      select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are
      fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the
      Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.

   (( 5. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you
   to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all
   of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then
   you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
   possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from
   adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they
   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer
   programming to be able to understand it.

   (( 6. ))??
   Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor
   or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated
   herein by this reference.

   (( 7. ))??
   Versions of This License.

      (( a. ))??
      New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new
      versions of the License.

      (( b. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a
      particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed
      Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
      by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.

      (( c. ))??
      Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version
      of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software
      that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename
      your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and
      must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this
      License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of
      Licensor or any Contributor.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN
   AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE
   OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE
   LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 9. ))??
   Termination.

      (( a. ))??
      Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted
      hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the
      terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of
      becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that
      are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license.
      Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
      termination of this License, shall survive.

      (( b. ))??
      Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate
      litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or
      Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as
      Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent
      to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively
      upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless
      within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay
      Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future
      use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your
      litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent.
      If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement
      are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation
      claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under
      Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice
      Period.

      (( c. ))??
      Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement
      claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
      license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
      Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( d. ))??
      No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under
      Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding
      licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by
      you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
      termination.

   (( 10. ))??
   Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
   WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE
   LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY
   SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
   EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
   OR PERSONAL INJURY

   RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
   SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
   OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY
   NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 11. ))??
   Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party
   is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor
   and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
   Nothing herein is intended or

   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   (( 12. ))??
   U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that
   term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial
   computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such
   terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
   12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
   Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set
   forth herein.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
   subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
   to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law
   provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
   excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any
   litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
   the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California or the Superior
   Court of the County of Santa Clara, California (as appropriate), with venue
   lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible
   for costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and
   Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation
   concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that
   provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 14. ))??
   Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, whether in
   upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
   under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future
   version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you
   includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
   control with you. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the
   power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
   entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
   (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of
   such entity.

(( BitTorrent Open Source License

Version 1.1 ))??

This BitTorrent Open Source License (the "License") applies to the BitTorrent
client and related software products as well as any updates or maintenance
releases of that software ("BitTorrent Products") that are distributed by
BitTorrent, Inc. ("Licensor"). Any BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this
License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected
by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may
use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.

Preamble

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of
this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal
effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not
this Preamble.

This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the
Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the "JOSL"), which has been approved by Open
Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been deleted.

This License provides that:

   (( 1. ))??
   You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an
   aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different
   sources. No royalty or other fee is required.

   (( 2. ))??
   Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including
   Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The
   terms "Licensed Product," "Modifications," "Contributors" and "Source Code"
   are defined in the License.)

   (( 3. ))??
   You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can
   create Derivative Works from it. (The term "Derivative Works" is defined in
   the License.)

   (( 4. ))??
   By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you
   agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then
   distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you
   must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others free of
   charge and without a royalty.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for
   executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other
   fee to the Licensor or any Contributor, provided that such executable
   versions contain your or another Contributor's material Modifications. For
   the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed
   Product does not contain your or another Contributor's material
   Modifications, you may not sell, accept donations or otherwise receive
   compensation for such executable.

   You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not
   providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any
   liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or
   causes you any injury or damages.

   (( 6. ))??
   If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge
   fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability
   obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for, sell, accept donations
   or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code.

   (( 7. ))??
   If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed
   Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the
   Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.

You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case
the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they
do to the original Licensed Product.

Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice.
If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to
fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to
publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that
consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing

Modifications.

New versions of this License may be published from time to time in connection
with new versions of a Licensed Product or otherwise. You may choose to continue
to use the license terms in this version of the License for the Licensed Product
that was originally licensed hereunder, however, the new versions of this
License will at all times apply to new versions of the Licensed Product released
by Licensor after the release of the new version of this License. Only the
Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed
Product.

This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are
defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your
convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.

License Terms

   (( 1. ))??
   Grant of License From Licensor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
   license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the
   following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any
      Modifications created by a Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source
      Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part
      of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 2. ))??
   Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. "Modifications" means any
   additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file
   containing a Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of
   a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term "Licensed Product"
   shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any
   Contributor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, By
   application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity
   who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a
   Modification (a "Contributor") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims,
   to do the following:

      (( a. ))??
      Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any
      Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both
      Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or
      as part of Derivative Works.

      (( b. ))??
      Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
      Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
      otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the
      extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell,
      offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or
      portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

   (( 3. ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
   grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
   other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as
   expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the
   Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for
   combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No
   right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if
   such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License
   shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different
   terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right
   to license. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you
   hereby agree that you will not, without the prior written consent of
   Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
   intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly
   stated herein. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing,
   you hereby agree that you will not use or display any trademark of Licensor
   or any Contributor in any domain name, directory filepath, advertisement,
   link or other reference to you in any manner or in any media.

   (( 4. ))??
   Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.

      (( a. ))??
      Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition
      for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any
      Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you
      distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without
      limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you
      contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
      future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include
      a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you
      distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter
      or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
      rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering
      the additional rights described in Section 4(d).

      (( b. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. You must make available, without charge,
      under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product
      and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you
      distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a
      mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the
      electronic transfer of data (an "Electronic Distribution Mechanism"). The
      Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you
      distribute must remain available for as long as any executable or other
      form of the Licensed Product is distributed by you. You are responsible
      for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( c. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters.

         (( i. ))??
         Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third
         party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights
         granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source
         Code distribution titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any
         Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall
         promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been
         obtained.

         (( ii. ))??
         Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application
         programming interface ("API") and you have knowledge of patent licenses
         that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( iii. ))??
         Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to
         4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are
         your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant
         the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( d. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you
      provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to
      which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe
      recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the
      notice contained in Exhibit A (the "Notice") in each file of the Source
      Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a
      Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it
      is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to
      its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
      notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed
      Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf
      of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you
      alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor
      as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.

      (( e. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product
      as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain
      terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the
      requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that distribution, (ii) you
      include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related
      documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code
      version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this
      License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms
      that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or
      any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as
      a result of any terms you offer.

      (( f. ))??
      Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g.,
      combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and
      distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you
      select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are
      fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the
      Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.

      (( g. ))??
      Compensation for Distribution of Executable Versions of Licensed Products,
      Modifications or Derivative Works. Notwithstanding any provision of this
      License to the contrary, by distributing, selling, licensing, sublicensing
      or otherwise making available any Licensed Product, or Modification or
      Derivative Work thereof, you and Licensor hereby acknowledge and agree
      that you may sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or
      otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed
      Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any
      other Contributor, provided that such executable versions (i) contain your
      or another Contributor's material Modifications, or (ii) are otherwise
      material Derivative Works. For purposes of this License, an executable
      version of the Licensed Product will be deemed to contain a material
      Modification, or will otherwise be deemed a material Derivative Work, if
      (a) the Licensed Product is modified with your own or a third party's
      software programs or other code, and/or the Licensed Product is combined
      with a number of your own or a third party's software programs or code,
      respectively, and (b) such software programs or code add or contribute
      material value, functionality or features to the License Product. For the
      avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed
      Product does not contain your or another Contributor's material
      Modifications or is otherwise not a material Derivative Work, in each case
      as contemplated herein, you may not sell, license or sublicense for a fee,
      accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable.
      Additionally, without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding any
      provision of this License to the contrary, you cannot charge for, sell,
      license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive
      compensation for the Source Code.

   (( 5. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you
   to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all
   of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then
   you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
   possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from
   adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they
   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer
   programming to be able to understand it.

   (( 6. ))??
   Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor
   or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated
   herein by this reference.

   Versions of This License.

      (( a. ))??
      New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new
      versions of the License.

      (( b. ))??
      Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a
      particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under
      the terms of that version, provided that any such license be in full force
      and effect at the time, and has not been revoked or otherwise terminated.
      You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any
      subsequent version (but not any prior version) of the License published by
      Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms
      applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.

      (( c. ))??
      Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version
      of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software
      that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename
      your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and
      must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this
      License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of
      Licensor or any Contributor.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN
   AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE
   OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE
   LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 9. ))??
   Termination.

      (( a. ))??
      Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted
      hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the
      terms herein and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days of being
      notified of the breach by the Licensor. For purposes of this provision,
      proof of delivery via email to the address listed in the 'WHOIS' database
      of the registrar for any website through which you distribute or market
      any Licensed Product, or to any alternate email address which you
      designate in writing to the Licensor, shall constitute sufficient
      notification. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly
      granted shall survive any termination of this license so long as they
      continue to complye with the terms of this License. Provisions that, by
      their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
      License, shall survive.

      (( b. ))??
      Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate
      litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or
      Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as
      Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent
      to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively
      upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless
      within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay
      Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future
      use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your
      litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent.
      If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement
      are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation
      claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under
      Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice
      Period.

      (( c. ))??
      Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement
      claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
      license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said
      Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( d. ))??
      No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under
      Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding
      licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by
      you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
      termination.

   (( 10. ))??
   Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
   WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE
   LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY
   SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
   EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
   OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 11. ))??
   Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party
   is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor
   and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
   Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of
   liability.

   (( 12. ))??
   U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that
   term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial
   computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such
   terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
   12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
   Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set
   forth herein.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the
   subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
   to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law
   provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
   excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that in any
   litigation relating to this license the losing party shall be responsible for
   costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law
   or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be
   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 14. ))??

   upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
   under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future
   version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you

PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__

perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

__1__

hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory
license fees, residuals or any other payments;

__1__
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common

however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__

(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not

You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions).

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author,
as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference
to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS

above.

modified.";

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License

royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License; and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
4(b), as requested.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You.

__1__ //** Non-standard paragraph break. **//
This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

__1__ produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

__1__
Attribution.

__1__
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

__1__ retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

__1__ identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested  by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

__1__ a copyright notice;

__1__ a notice that refers to this Public License;

__1__ a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

__1__ a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

__1__ indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
any previous modifications; and

__1__ indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
License.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

__1__ If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

((License))??

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

__1__
By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

__1__
Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license
rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted
hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory
license fees, residuals or any other payments;

__1__
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common
law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

__1__
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

__1__
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties.__1__ For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public
digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

performances of the Work, including by public digital
performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
means including signs, sounds or images.

__1__ "Reproduce" means to make copies of
the Work by any means including without limitation by
sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this
License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses
free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections;

__1__ to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
a modification could indicate "The original work has been
modified.";

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
4(c), as requested.

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License if Your exercise of such
rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise
than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b)
and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme;
and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
permitted under Section 4(c).

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").
To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms
and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of
benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
NonCommercial purposes only; and

__1__ produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
than for NonCommercial purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

__1__
Attribution.

__1__
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

__1__ retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

__1__ identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested  by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

__1__ a copyright notice;

__1__ a notice that refers to this Public License;

__1__ a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

__1__ a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

__1__ indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
any previous modifications; and

__1__ indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
License.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

__1__ If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   __1__ Definitions

      __1__ "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified
      form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate
      and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
      Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

      __1__ "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
      dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
      art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
      Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
      constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
      the purpose of this License.

      __1__ "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
      Work.

      __1__ "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
      terms of this License.

      __1__ "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
      respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
      Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
      violation.

   __1__ Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
   or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
   on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
   applicable laws.

   __1__ License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise
   the rights in the Work as stated below:

      __1__ to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collective Works;

      __1__ to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
      the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
      known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
      such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
      other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
      hereby reserved.

   __1__ Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

      __1__ You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
      must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
      License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
      publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms
      of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
      You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
      access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
      License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
      the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
      create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
      Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

      __1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
      above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
      commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the
      Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
      otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
      commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is
      no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of
      copyrighted works.

      __1__ If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact
      all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
      reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
      (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
      of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
      manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a
      minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
      credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
      comparable authorship credit.

   __1__ Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

      __1__ By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor
      represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after
      reasonable inquiry:

         __1__ Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant
         the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the
         rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any
         royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;

         __1__ The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity
         rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or
         constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to
         any third party.

      __1__ EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN
      WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS"
      BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR
      ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

   __1__ Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING
   FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
   LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
   PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   __1__ Termination

      __1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
      Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under
      this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
      such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.

      __1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
      is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
      under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
      time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
      this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
      granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   __1__ Miscellaneous

      __1__ Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
      Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
      this License.

      __1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
      parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
      extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

      __1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
      breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
      signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

      __1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
      with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
      Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
      in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without
      the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works.  All
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a

publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted

compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and

copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.  Such credit may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
comparable authorship credit.

__1__
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties.__1__ For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.

US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public
digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__

received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

__1__

(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any

this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in
which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted

literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
and arrangement of their contents, constitute
intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
other contributions, each constituting separate and

assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an

if no individual or entity can be identified, the
publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works
or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a

plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
geography, topography, architecture or science; a
performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of
data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
literary or artistic work.

__1__ "You" means an individual or entity
exercising rights under this License who has not

respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

__1__ "Publicly Perform" means to perform
public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the
public those public recitations, by any means or process,

Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by
them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or
process and the communication to the public of the
performances of the Work, including by public digital
performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
means including signs, sounds or images.

__1__ "Reproduce" means to make copies of
the Work by any means including without limitation by

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this
License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses
free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make
Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
requested.

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name
of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if
supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such
credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
authors of Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License if Your exercise of such
rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise
than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b)
and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme;
and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
permitted under Section 4(b).

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must
not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License
("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such
rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
NonCommercial purposes only; and

__1__ produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial
purposes only.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
than for NonCommercial purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

__1__
Attribution.

__1__
If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:

__1__ retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed

__1__ a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

License.

License to Share Adapted Material.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not
Share Adapted Material;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or
impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of
this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties.  You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.  The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
the terms of this License.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory
license fees, residuals or any other payments;

__1__
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common
law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

__1__

REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not

transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or

the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a

Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
4(d), as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work
any credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested.

specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each
Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to
this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative
Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies
to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of this License.

__1__
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.  The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor

journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

__1__
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights
society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public
digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any

a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections;

__1__ to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
a modification could indicate "The original work has been
modified.";

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are

and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights described in
Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
4(d), as requested.

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation
only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later
version of this License with the same License Elements as
this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
license (either this or a later license version) that
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable
License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for
Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the
recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may
not impose any effective technological measures on the
Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License if Your exercise of such
rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise
than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)
and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme;
and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
permitted under Section 4(c).

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS
OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR
"LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.
TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A
CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__ "Collective Work" means a work, such
as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
with one or more other contributions, constituting
separate and independent works in themselves, are
assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
this License.

__1__ "Derivative Work" means a work based
upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing
works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be
recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

__1__ "Licensor" means the individual,
individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work
under the terms of this License.

__1__ "Original Author" means the
individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
the Work.

__1__ "Work" means the copyrightable work
of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

__1__ "You" means an individual or entity
exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with
respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

__1__ "License Elements" means the
following high-level license attributes as selected by
Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work
as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__ to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided
that any such Derivative Work, including any translation
in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
the original Work. For example, a translation could be
marked "The original work was translated from English to
Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
work has been modified.";

__1__ to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means
of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__ to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means
of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the
rights set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only
under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose
any technological measures on the Work that restrict the
ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(d),
as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit
as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

__1__ You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work
only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later
version of this License with the same License Elements as
this License; or, (iii) either the unported Creative
Commons license or a Creative Commons license for another
jurisdiction (either this or a later license version)
that contains the same License Elements as this License
(e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
(Unported ) )  ("the Applicable License"). You must include
a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the
Applicable License with every copy or phonorecord of each
Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works
that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights
granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. When You distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Derivative Work, You may not impose any technological
measures on the Derivative Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

__1__ You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital
file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

__1__ If You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as
defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as
defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request
has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to
the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of
the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; the title of
the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with
Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work
or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear,
if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part
of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
musical composition:

__1__ Performance Royalties Under Blanket
Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect whether individually or, in the
event that Licensor is a member of a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that
society, royalties for the public performance or
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work
if that performance is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation.

__1__ Mechanical Rights and Statutory
Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a music
rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create
from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
or private monetary compensation.

__1__ Webcasting Rights and Statutory
Royalties.__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, where the
Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or
the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public
digital performance is primarily intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE
EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE
LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY,
MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above)
or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from
You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a
Collective Work (as defined in Section 1 above), the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
You under this License.

__1__ Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use
to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following
considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do
not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract,
You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration
of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available
under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as
essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are
Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
NonCommercial purposes only; and

__1__ produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient
of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor
to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of
the Adapter’s License You apply.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
than for NonCommercial purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

__1__
Attribution.

__1__
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

__1__ retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

__1__ identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested  by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

__1__ a copyright notice;

__1__ a notice that refers to this Public License;

__1__ a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

__1__ a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

__1__ indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
any previous modifications; and

__1__ indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
License.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

__1__ ShareAlike.

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You
produce, the following conditions also apply.

__1__ The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible
License.

__1__ You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based
on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

__1__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted
Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's
License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if
supplied.  Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at
least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

__1__
By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

__1__
Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license
rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted
hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory
license fees, residuals or any other payments;

__1__
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common
law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

__1__
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

whatsoever in connection with the Work.  Creative Commons will not be liable to
You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising in connection to this license.  Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)
sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons"
or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written
consent of Creative Commons.  Any permitted use will be in compliance with

extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit
may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case
of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,

NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS

If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:
(i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or

the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the
extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that

comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any

this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work, the Licensor

as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__

agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS
OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR
"LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.

CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__ "Adaptation" means a work based upon
the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary
or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in
which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
including in any form recognizably derived from the
original, except that a work that constitutes a
Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a musical work, performance or
phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
License.

__1__ "Collection" means a collection of
literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
and arrangement of their contents, constitute
intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
other contributions, each constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, which together are
assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
License.

__1__ "Distribute" means to make available
to the public the original and copies of the Work through
sale or other transfer of ownership.

__1__ "Licensor" means the individual,

of a literary or artistic work, the individual,
individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or
if no individual or entity can be identified, the
publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works
or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the

artistic work offered under the terms of this License
including without limitation any production in the
literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
the mode or form of its expression including digital

lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a
musical composition with or without words; a

plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
geography, topography, architecture or science; a
performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of
data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
literary or artistic work.

__1__ "You" means an individual or entity
exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with
respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

__1__ "Publicly Perform" means to perform
public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the
public those public recitations, by any means or process,
including by wire or wireless means or public digital
performances; to make available to the public Works in
such a way that members of the public may access these
Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by
them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or
process and the communication to the public of the
performances of the Work, including by public digital
performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
means including signs, sounds or images.

__1__ "Reproduce" means to make copies of
the Work by any means including without limitation by
sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this
License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses
free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License; and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make
Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
requested.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made
pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name
of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if
supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such
credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these
credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must
not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Collections from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided
such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").
To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms
and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of
benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

__1__ produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

conditions.

License to Share Adapted Material.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by

information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database, provided You do not Share Adapted Material;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

__1__
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.

__1__
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

__1__
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.

__1__
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

__1__
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.

__1__
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

__1__
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

__1__
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;

__1__
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform.  You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement.  The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.  If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
requested.

__1__
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with
every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or
impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of
this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties.  You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.  The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
the terms of this License.

__1__
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

__1__

hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory
license fees, residuals or any other payments;

AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).  Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

__1__

terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

__1__
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here.  There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons"
or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written

for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use

Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").

in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
literary or artistic work.

__1__ "You" means an individual or entity
exercising rights under this License who has not

exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

__1__ to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collections;

__1__ to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
a modification could indicate "The original work has been
modified.";

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
as incorporated in Collections; and,

__1__ to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

__1__

For the avoidance of doubt:

__1__ Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License;

__1__ Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License; and,

__1__ Voluntary License Schemes. The
Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
4(c), as requested.

__1__ You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation
only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later
version of this License with the same License Elements as
this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
license (either this or a later license version) that
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US ) ) ; (iv) a Creative Commons
Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply
with the terms of that license. If you license the
Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
License"), you must comply with the terms of the
Applicable License generally and the following
provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI
for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that
restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict
the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
the terms of the Applicable License.

__1__ If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the
use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
translation of the Work by Original Author," or
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
least as prominent as the credits for the other
contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

__1__ Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

__1__ This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

__1__ Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

__1__ Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

__1__ If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

__1__ No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
charged with such waiver or consent.

__1__ This License constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the
Licensor and You.

__1__ The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To
the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted
the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and
conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits
the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these
terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

__1__ Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

__1__ Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as
essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

__1__ Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

__1__ Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

__1__ License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are
Attribution and ShareAlike.

__1__ Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

__1__ Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

__1__ Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

__1__ Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

__1__ Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

__1__ You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

__1__ License grant.

__1__ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
to:

__1__ reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

__1__ produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

__1__ Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

__1__ Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

__1__ Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to
do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.

__1__ Downstream recipients.

__1__ Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor to exercise
the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

__1__ Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient
of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an  offer from the Licensor
to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of
the Adapter’s License You apply.

__1__ No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or  conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

__1__ No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

__1__
Other rights.

__1__ Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

__1__ Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

__1__
Attribution.

__1__
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

__1__ retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

__1__ identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested  by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

__1__ a copyright notice;

__1__ a notice that refers to this Public License;

__1__ a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

__1__ a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

__1__ indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
any previous modifications; and

__1__ indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
License.

__1__ You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
information.

__1__ If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

__1__ ShareAlike.

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You
produce, the following conditions also apply.

__1__ The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

__1__ You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based
on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

__1__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted
Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's
License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

__1__ for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database;

__1__ if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

__1__ You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License
where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

__1__ Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.

__1__ To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License
or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

__1__ The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

__1__ This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

__1__

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
it reinstates:

__1__ automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

__1__ upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

__1__ Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

__1__ The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

__1__ Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

__1__ For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

__1__ To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall
be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions.

__1__ No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

__1__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best of his
knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of the
country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates whatever
copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship identified below (the
"Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright
interest he may have in the associated work, and for these purposes, is
described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of this
work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield him from
liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and
future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the Work.
Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes the
relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and
in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or conceived.

AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS
DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY
FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER. ))??

((Statement of Purpose))??

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

   __1__ Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

      __1__ the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;

      __1__ moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
      performer(s);

      __1__ publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;

      __1__ rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph __2__, below;

      __1__ rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
      data in a Work;

      __1__ database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
      the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

      __1__ other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

   __1__ Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
   of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably
   and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's
   Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action,
   whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and
   causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to
   the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
   Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
   Statement of Purpose.

   __1__ Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
   be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
   Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
   and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
   in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
   provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
   (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
   for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
   advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be
   deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
   Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
   ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness
   shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
   hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
   remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
   associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
   case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

   __1__ Limitations and Disclaimers.

      __1__ No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
      abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

      __1__ Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent
      permissible under applicable law.

      __1__ Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
      persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further,
      Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
      permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

      __1__ Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose

      survive.

      (( 6.2. ))??

   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 8. ))??

   provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
   License.

   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

      Effect of New Versions.

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
      being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
      to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the
      license steward.

      (( 4.3. ))??
      Modified Versions.

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
      Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
      License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the
      name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from
      this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains
      terms which differ from this License.

   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 6. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
      survive.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
      actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer
      or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
      "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
      Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
      Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly
      or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
      Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
      Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of
      such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
      withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
      Participant.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent
      where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to
      the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
      value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or
      2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
      payment or license.

      (( 6.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
      licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
      hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
      distributor) shall survive termination.

   (( 7. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
   ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 8. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as
   that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1) and "commercial
   computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
   (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
   through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered

   regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other
   countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
   Software.

   (( 10. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial

   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

      Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
      on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
      of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
      include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2 ))??
      Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4 ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
         third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
         rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
         Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
         titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim
         in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
         Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
         available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
         mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
         received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
         programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
         which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
         also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed
         pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
         Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
         and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
         by this License.

      (( 3.5 ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
      file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location
      (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for
      such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
      name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
      describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
      the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6 ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
      the Initial Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby
      agree to indemnify the Initial Developer, Original Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer, Original
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7 ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1 ))??
      New Versions.

      Socialtext, Inc. ("Socialtext") may publish revised and/or new versions of
      the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
      version number.

      (( 6.2 ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No one
      other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.

      (( 6.3 ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Socialtext", "CPAL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
      appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
      License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the CPAL. (Filling in the name of the
      Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
      notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
      modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
   ORIGINAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

      (( 8.1 ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2 ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original
      Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or
      Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
      "Participant") alleging that:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( (b) ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3 ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4 ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
   ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
   CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
   INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
   COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each
   party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
   with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute
   such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits
   you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or
   the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the
   file described in Exhibit A.

   (( 14. ))??
   ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION

      (( (a) ))??
      As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the
      Original Code ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional
      value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the
      Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B
      ("Attribution Information") a requirement that each time an Executable and
      Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes
      initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original Developer's
      Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user
      interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may
      include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image
      should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the
      Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable
      and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the
      Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code
      displays such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the
      form of a splash screen, notice at login, an "about" display, or dedicated
      attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form
      for that Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement
      for notice.

      (( (b) ))??
      Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief
      phrase, graphic image and a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject
      to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent
      shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to
      the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include
      Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must
      ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall
      be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar
      information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original
      Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above
      attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code
      resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger
      Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution,
      therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any
      time, more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a)
      a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a
      word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image
      provided by the Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the
      "Attribution Limits").

      (( c ))??
      If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are
      no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the
      Original Developer.

      (( (d) ))??
      You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names
      contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered
      Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with
      the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted
      by law or as expressly set out in this License.

   (( 15. ))??
   ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.

   The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication
   of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code
   or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works
   are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an
   application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the
   grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of
   the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and
   make Source Code available under Section 3.2.

(( Common Public License Version 1.0 ))??

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
(( 1. ))??

DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

   (( a) ))??
   in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
   distributed under this Agreement, and

   (( b) ))??
   in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

      (( i) ))??
      changes to the Program, and

      (( ii) ))??
      additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.
(( 2. ))??

GRANT OF RIGHTS

   (( a) ))??
   Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
   such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

   (( b) ))??
   Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
   Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
   transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
   object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
   Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
   Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
   covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
   other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
   licensed hereunder.

   (( c) ))??
   Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
   its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
   Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
   intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
   any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
   infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
   needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
   allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
   to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

   (( d) ))??
   Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
   rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth
   in this Agreement.
   (( 3. ))??

REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

   (( a) ))??
   it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

   (( b) ))??
   its license agreement:

      (( i) ))??
      effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
      conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
      title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
      merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

      (( ii) ))??
      effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
      damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
      damages, such as lost profits;

      (( iii) ))??
      states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
      that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

      (( iv) ))??
      states that source code for the Program is available from such
      Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner
      on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

   (( a) ))??
   it must be made available under this Agreement; and

   (( b) ))??
   a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

   Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
   the Program.

   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
   if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
   the originator of the Contribution.
   (( 4. ))??

COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.
(( 5. ))??

NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
(( 6. ))??

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
(( 7. ))??

GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

(( The Clarified Artistic License ))??

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified
below.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

"Distribution fee" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this Package to
another party.

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the right to use the item,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
received it.

   (( 1. ))??
   You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
   Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
   of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from the Copyright
   Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
   Standard Version.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
      equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network archive
      site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the Copyright
      Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
      Package.

      (( b) ))??
      use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      (( c) ))??
      rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
      standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
      manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
      differs from the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

      (( e) ))??
      permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package
      permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some specific
      way.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
      together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
      get the Standard Version.

      (( b) ))??
      accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
      with your modifications.

      (( c) ))??
      give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the
      differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on
      where to get the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

      (( e) ))??
      offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your modifications,
      by mail order.

   (( 5. ))??
   You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package. If
   you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose for
   that support. You may not charge a license fee for the right to use this
   Package itself. You may distribute this Package in aggregate with other
   (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a larger
   (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution, and charge
   license fees for other parts of that software distribution, provided that you
   do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. If the Package
   includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's interpreter within an
   executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of
   aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter
   is so embedded.

   (( 6. ))??
   The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
   the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
   this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold
   commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or
   library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump" or
   "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of
   such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package
   nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that
   you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
   Package.

   (( 7. ))??
   C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
   supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines
   and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered
   part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6,
   provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would
   cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

   (( 8. ))??
   Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial
   distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is
   embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's
   interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use
   shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

   (( 9. ))??

   conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
   modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
   Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   (( 6. ))??
   Trademarks.

   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

((THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM))??
IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
((THE PROGRAM || THIS SOFTWARE))
CONSTITUTES
((THE))??
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   (( 1. ))??
   DEFINITIONS

   "Contribution" means:

      (( a) ))??
      in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
      distributed under this Agreement, and

      (( b) ))??
      in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

         (( i) ))??
         changes to the Program, and

         (( ii) ))??
         additions to the Program;

         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
         are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
         Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
         Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
         separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
         Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
         works of the Program.

   "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

   "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
   necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
   combined with the Program.

   "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
   Agreement.

   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
   including all Contributors.

   (( 2. ))??
   GRANT OF RIGHTS

      (( a) ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      (( b) ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
      the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
      by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
      combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
      shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
      No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      (( c) ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
      to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
      disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      (( d) ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
      license set forth in this Agreement.

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
   its own license agreement, provided that:

      (( a) ))??
      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      (( b) ))??
      its license agreement:

         (( i) ))??
         effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
         conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
         title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

         (( ii) ))??
         effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         (( iii) ))??
         states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
         by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         (( iv) ))??
         states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

   When the Program is made available in source code form:

      (( a) ))??
      it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      (( b) ))??
      a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
      within the Program.

   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
   if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
   the originator of the Contribution.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
   offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
   losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
   lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
   Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
   Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
   a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
   to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
   property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
   a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
   b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
   at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
   that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
   court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
   Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
   associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
   not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
   applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
   EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
   (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
   infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
   under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
   order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
   modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
   publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
   time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
   Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
   Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
   Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
   be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
   Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
   Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
   the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
   (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
   stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
   licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
   Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
   rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are
   reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of __2__ and the
   intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
   Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
   after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
   in any resulting litigation.

      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or
      other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
      Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by
      the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination
      to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply
      to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
      se is licensed hereunder.

      (( c) ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
      to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
      disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      (( d) ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
      license set forth in this Agreement.

      (( e) ))??
      Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes
      additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this
      Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under
      the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section
      3).

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

      (( 3.1 ))??
      If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

         (( a) ))??
         the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance
         with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a
         statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this
         Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange;
         and

         (( b) ))??
         the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different
         than this Agreement, provided that such license:

            (( i) ))??
            effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
            warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
            or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
            purpose;

            (( ii) ))??
            effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
            liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
            incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

            (( iii) ))??
            does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the
            Source Code under section 3.2; and

            (( iv) ))??
            requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to
            be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section
            3.

      (( 3.2 ))??
      When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

         (( a) ))??
         it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)
         is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
         available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor
         attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this
         Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of
         such Secondary Licenses, and

         (( b) ))??
         a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.

      (( 3.3 ))??
      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark,
      attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability
      ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of the Program
      which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own
      appropriate notices.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
   offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
   losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
   lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
   Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
   Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
   a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
   to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
   property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
   a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
   b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
   at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
   that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
   court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
   Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
   BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
   Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
   this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
   errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
   or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
   BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
   LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER
   CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
   OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
   OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
   (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
   infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
   under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
   order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
   modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
   publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
   time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
   Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
   Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
   Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
   be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
   Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the
   Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
   the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program
   (including its Contributions) under the new version.

   Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
   receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
   Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
   or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
   Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be
   enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No
   third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

   Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

   "This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary
   Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse
   Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and
   exceptions or additional permissions here}."

   Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not
   sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

   If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
   then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
   relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
   notice.

   You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

   modification.

   Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of
   the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this
   Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this
   Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any
   additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or
   restrict the terms of the Licence.

   Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates
   Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and
   another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or
   Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the
   sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence" refers to the licences listed in
   the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations
   under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this
   Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

   Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of
   the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
   Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely
   available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or
   communicate the Work.

   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

   (( 6. ))??
   Chain of Authorship

   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
   granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
   has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
   brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
   he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each time You, as a Licensee, receive the Work, the original Licensor and
   subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the
   Work, under the terms of this Licence.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty

   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
   contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
   "bugs" inherent to this type of software development.

   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is"
   basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
   without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
   of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
   rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
   condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Liability

   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
   natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or
   indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence
   or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
   commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility
   of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product
   liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

   Additional agreements

   While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
   conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance
   of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
   services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
   Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
   Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
   against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or
   additional liability.

   (( 10. ))??
   Acceptance of the Licence

   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I
   agree" placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this
   Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with
   the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and
   irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

   Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
   conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
   Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative
   Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies
   thereof.

   (( 11. ))??

   In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of
   electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the
   Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example,
   a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by
   the applicable law regarding the identification and address of the Licensor,
   the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and
   reproduced by the Licensee.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination of the Licence

   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

   Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
   received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
   remain in full compliance with the Licence.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
   agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
   law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
   whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to
   make it valid and enforceable.

   The European Commission may put into force translations and/or binding new
   versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable. New
   versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number. The
   new version of the Licence becomes binding for You as soon as You become
   aware of its publication.

   (( 14. ))??

   Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
   between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be
   subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European
   Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the
   European Community.

   Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission,
   and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or
   conducts its primary business.

   (( 15. ))??
   Applicable Law

   This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where
   the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

   (( 5. ))??
   Obligations of the Licensee

   The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
   obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

   Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
   trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
   disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices
   and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes
   and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
   prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of
   modification.

   Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of
   the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this
   Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this
   Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is
   expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee
   (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions
   on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
   Licence.

   Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates
   Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and
   another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or
   Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the
   sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence," refers to the licences listed in
   the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations
   under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this
   Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

   Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of
   the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
   Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely
   available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or
   communicate the Work.

   Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

   (( 6. ))??
   Chain of Authorship

   The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
   granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
   has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
   brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
   he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

   Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
   Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under
   the terms of this Licence.

   (( 7. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty

   The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
   contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
   "bugs" inherent to this type of software development.

   For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is"
   basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
   without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
   of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
   rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

   This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
   condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

   (( 8. ))??
   Disclaimer of Liability

   Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
   natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or
   indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence
   or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
   commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility
   of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product
   liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

   (( 9. ))??
   Additional agreements

   While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
   conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance
   of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
   services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
   Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
   Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
   against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or
   additional liability.

   (( 10. ))??
   Acceptance of the Licence

   The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I
   agree" placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this

   a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by
   the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
   accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

   (( 12. ))??
   Termination of the Licence

   The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a
   termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received
   the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in
   full compliance with the Licence.

   (( 13. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
   agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

   If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
   law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
   whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to
   make it valid and enforceable.

   The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new
   versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without
   reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the
   Licence will be published with a unique version number.

   have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
   their choice.

This European Union Public Licence (the 'EUPL') applies to the Work (as defined
below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work,
other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such
use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Work:

   Licensed under the EUPL

   or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the

      —
      'Derivative Works': the works or software that could be created by the
      Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
      Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the

      —
      'The Work': the Original Work or its Derivative Works.

      —

      communicates the Work under the Licence.

      of the Work under the terms of the Licence.

Preamble

The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy
of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the
Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them
their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
MODIFICATION



   __1__ This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
   to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either
   the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
   verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as "you".



   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
   recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with
   the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
   copy.



   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1
   above, provided that you also do the following:

      __1__ cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
      changed the files and the date of any change; and

      __1__ cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or
      without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties
      under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose
      to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your
      option).

      __1__ If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement
      including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
      warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
      redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
      to view a copy of this General Public License.

      __1__ You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
      and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
      fee.

   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
   derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
   the other work under the scope of these terms.



   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
   it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      __1__ accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2
      above; or,

      __1__ accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of
      distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
      code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

      __1__ accompany it with the information you received as to where the
      corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed
      only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
      in object code or executable form alone.)

   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it
   need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that
   accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for
   standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating
   system.



   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
   Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
   Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the
   Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
   rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not
   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
   compliance.



   __1__ By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on
   the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all
   its terms and conditions.



   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein.



   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,
   you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
   ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.



   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

((  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS))??

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

__30__
//**
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave,
Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ` + "`" + `show w'. This is free software, and
you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type ` + "`" + `show c' for
details.

The hypothetical commands ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here a
sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU
((Lesser||Library))
General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

__5__ TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
   terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
   such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
   Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
      thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
      Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      __1__ Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      __1__ Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties to this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
   you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
   ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there
is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the
GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems
will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   __1__ Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
   individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
   or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
   Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
   activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
   displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there
   is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
   criterion.

   __1__ Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
   defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
   specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used
   among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
   work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
   Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
   to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
   Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in
   source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
   essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
   operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler
   used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
   object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
   For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
   between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   __1__ Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
   License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
   This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
   provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
   conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
   covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
   those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
   conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
   with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

   __1__ Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
   restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   __1__ Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
   that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
   apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
   and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   __1__ Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
   provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
      and giving a relevant date.

      __1__ The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
      notices".

      __1__ You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      __1__ If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
      not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
   and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
   of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion
   of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
   other parts of the aggregate.

   __1__ Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
   4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
   Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
      for software interchange.

      __1__ Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
      possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source
      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a
      price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
      network server at no charge.

      __1__ Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
      allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
      the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      __1__ Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
      Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You
      need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with
      the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or
      a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
      needed to satisfy these requirements.

      __1__ Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
      6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
   conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
   personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
   purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
   In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall
   be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
   particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
   class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
   way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to
   use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the
   product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless
   such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
   transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
   how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed
   under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But
   this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains
   the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
   the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
   communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
   with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
   require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   __1__ Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
   additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
   you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added
   by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
   copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      __1__ Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      __1__ Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or

      __1__ Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
      ways as different from the original version; or

      __1__ Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

      __1__ Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
      names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      __1__ Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
      by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
      authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
   by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may
   remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but
   permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered
   work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that
   the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
   apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
   terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
   apply either way.

   __1__ Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
   particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
   the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
   permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
   some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
   of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
   your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
   qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   __1__ Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
   of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
   consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise
   does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants
   you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
   or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License
   to do so.

   __1__ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
   third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work
   from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
   with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
   portion of it.

   __1__ Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with
   the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
   of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to
   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
   party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
   charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or
   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
   extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means
   you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying
   the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in
   a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country
   that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
   this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
   arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
   of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
   grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
   discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered
   work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for
   and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
   covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
   license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

   __1__ No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work
   so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at
   all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a
   royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
   only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   __1__ Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
   link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
   GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
   the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
   part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
   Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a
   network will apply to the combination as such.

   __1__ Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
   new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
   "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
   version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
   ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
   GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
   acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
   the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   __1__ Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   __1__ Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
   DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
   HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   __1__ Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
   shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of
   all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
   assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a
   fee.

(( END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS))??

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

__30__
//**
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
**//

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program. If not, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<program> __10__

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ` + "`" + `show w'.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
conditions; type ` + "`" + `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands ` + "`" + `show w' and ` + "`" + `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be
different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https:/www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.))??

(( IBM Public License Version 1.0 ))??

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM

PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION

OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   (( 1. ))??
   DEFINITIONS

   "Contribution" means:

      (( a. ))??
      in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the
      Original Program, and

      (( b. ))??
      in the case of each Contributor,

         (( i. ))??
         changes to the Program, and

         (( ii. ))??
         additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the
         Program originate from and are distributed by that particular
         Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was
         added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
         such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
         the Program which:

            (( (i) ))??
            are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with

            the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not

            derivative works of the Program.

   "Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

   "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
   necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
   combined with the Program.

   "Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying
   this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and
   documentation, if any.

   "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.

   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
   including all Contributors.

   (( 2. ))??
   GRANT OF RIGHTS

      (( a. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      (( b. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
      the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
      by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
      combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
      shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
      No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      (( c. ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the

      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are

      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the

      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.

      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims

      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual

      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the

      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes

      sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights

      needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is

      required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is

      Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before

      distributing the Program.

      (( d. ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has

      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the

      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
   its own license agreement, provided that:

      (( a. ))??
      it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      (( b. ))??
      its license agreement:

         (( i. ))??
         effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
         conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
         title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
         merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

         (( ii. ))??
         effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         (( iii. ))??
         states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
         by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

         (( iv. ))??
         states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

   When the Program is made available in source code form:

      (( a. ))??
      it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      (( b. ))??
      a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

   Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the
   Program:

   Copyright (C) __5__ International Business Machines Corporation and
   others. All Rights Reserved.

   In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
   Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
   Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
   offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
   losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
   lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
   Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
   Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
   a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
   to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
   property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
   a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
   b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim
   at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
   that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
   court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
   Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
   associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
   not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
   applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
   EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
   to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
   in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
   Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
   is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
   entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
   or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from
   time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
   distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
   always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
   was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
   Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
   under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this
   Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
   Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
   Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
   or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
   Agreement are reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
   intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
   Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
   after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
   in any resulting litigation.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose
authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so
that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually
obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary
software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,
the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.
This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in
full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary
license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they
blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program
and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the
library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running
a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense,
the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library,
and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License
for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most
developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might
promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.
This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free
programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such
programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have
not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have
achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope
is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
Public License rather than by this special one.

((GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE))??
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
   be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also
   called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
   as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
   those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
   been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
   either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
   say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
   "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
   code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
   files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
   library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
   using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
   (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
   that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
   the Library does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
   License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The modified work must itself be a software library.

      __1__ You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
      all third parties under the terms of this License.

      __1__ If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
      facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
      then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
      application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
      operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
      purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
      Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function
      or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
      not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
   the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
   you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
   to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this
   License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
   Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
   wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
   so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
   and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
   into a program that is not a library.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
   corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
   the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
   interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
   from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
   is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
   derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
   License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
   executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
   of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
   is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
   of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
   part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
   the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
   especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
   the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
   precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
   and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
   in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
   whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
   code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
   object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
   containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
   linked directly with the Library itself.

   __1__ As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a
   "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
   portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
   provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's
   own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
   used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
   must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
   copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
   among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
   License. Also, you must do one of these things:

      __1__ Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
      source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
      produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
      understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
      the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
      use the modified definitions.)

      __1__ Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
      above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
      distribution.

      __1__ If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from
      a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      __1__ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
      or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
   include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
   from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
   not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
   form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
   operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
   accompanies the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
   other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
   system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
   together in an executable that you distribute.

   __1__ You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
   covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided
   that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the
   other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
   these two things:

      __1__ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      __1__ Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
      part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
      the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
   is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
   the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may
   choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
   the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
   Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

((  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS))??

(( How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

__30__

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.
A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

((GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE))??

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   __1__ This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
   which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
   party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
   Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
   "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
   as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
   those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
   been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
   either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
   say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
   "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
   code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
   files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
   library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
   using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
   (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
   that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
   the Library does.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
   License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   __1__ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      __1__ The modified work must itself be a software library.

      __1__ You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      __1__ You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
      all third parties under the terms of this License.

      __1__ If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
      facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
      then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
      application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
      operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
   that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
   Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
   by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
   square root function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
   which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
   on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
   the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
   the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
   the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   __1__ You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
   you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
   to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this
   License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
   Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
   wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
   so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
   and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
   into a program that is not a library.

   __1__ You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
   corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
   the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
   interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
   from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.

   __1__ A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
   is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
   derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
   License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
   executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
   of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
   is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
   of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
   part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
   the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
   especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
   the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
   precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
   and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
   in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
   whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
   code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
   object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
   containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
   linked directly with the Library itself.

   __1__ As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
   "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
   portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
   provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's
   own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
   used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
   must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
   copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
   among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
   License. Also, you must do one of these things:

      __1__ Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
      source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
      produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
      understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
      the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
      use the modified definitions.)

      __1__ Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
      Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of
      the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
      copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
      properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one,
      as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
      that the work was made with.

      __1__ Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
      above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
      distribution.

      __1__ If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from
      a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      __1__ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
      or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
   include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
   from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed
   need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
   binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
   operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
   accompanies the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
   other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
   system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
   together in an executable that you distribute.

   __1__ You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
   covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided
   that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the
   other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
   these two things:

      __1__ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      __1__ Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
      part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
      the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   __1__ You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
   is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

   __1__ You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

   __1__ Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
   the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   __1__ If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
   you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
   pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
   Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
   cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   __1__ If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   __1__ The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
   version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may
   choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   __1__ If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
   the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
   Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   __1__ BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   __1__ IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

((END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS))??

((How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below.

   __1__ Additional Definitions.



      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
      General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
      General Public License.



      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
      than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.



      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
      the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a
      subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an
      interface provided by the Library.



      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
      Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with
      which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".



      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
      Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
      portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on
      the Application, and not on the Linked Version.



      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
      code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and
      utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
      Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

   __1__ Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
   being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   __1__ Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
   refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
   facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
   then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

      __1__ under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or
      data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
      purpose remains meaningful, or

      __1__ under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
      License applicable to that copy.

   __1__ Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
   file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
   of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
   numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
   inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
   the following:

      __1__ Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
      License.

      __1__ Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
      license document.

   __1__ Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
   together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
   Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
   such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

      __1__ Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
      License.

      __1__ Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
      license document.

      __1__ For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
      notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the
      GNU GPL and this license document.

      __1__ Do one of the following:

         __1__ Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
         and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
         Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
         modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
         GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

         __1__ Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
         Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy
         of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b)
         will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
         interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

      __1__ Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
      required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and
      only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
      execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
      relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
      (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the
      Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
      use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the
      manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
      Source.)

   __1__ Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
   side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
   Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
   library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

      __1__ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under
      the terms of this License.

      __1__ Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
      work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
      uncombined form of the same work.

   __1__ Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
   received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
   option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
   or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
   Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
   future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
   proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
   authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   (( 1. ))??
   DEFINITIONS

   "Contribution" means:

      (( a. ))??
      in the case of
      //** <ORGANIZATION> **//
      __5__
      ("
      //** <OWNER> **//
      __5__
      "), the Original Program, and

      (( b. ))??
      in the case of each Contributor,

         (( i. ))??
         changes to the Program, and

         (( ii. ))??
         additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the
         Program originate from and are "Contributed" by that particular
         Contributor.

         A Contribution is "Contributed" by a Contributor only (i) if it was
         added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
         such Contributor's behalf, and (ii) the Contributor explicitly
         consents, in accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the
         changes and/or additions as Contributions. Contributions do not include
         additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
         distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license
         agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

         "Contributor" means
         //** <OWNER> **//
         __5__
         and any other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the
         Program.

         "Distributor" means a Recipient that distributes the Program,
         modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.

         "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
         are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
         or when combined with the Program.

         "Original Program" means the original version of the software
         accompanying this Agreement as released by
         //** <OWNER> **//
         __5__
         , including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

         "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part
         thereof

         "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
         including all Contributors.

   (( 2. ))??
   GRANT OF RIGHTS

      (( a. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      (( b. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also
      apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the
      Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
      addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
      Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not
      apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to
      (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed
      hereunder.

      (( c. ))??
      Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
      to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
      disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
      As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
      each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
      intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      (( d. ))??
      Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
      license set forth in this Agreement.

   (( 3. ))??
   REQUIREMENTS

      (( A. ))??
      Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this
      Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:

         (( 1. ))??
         it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

         (( 2. ))??
         if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a
         copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is
         included with each copy of the Program; and

         (( 3. ))??
         if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license
         agreement:

            (( a. ))??
            effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
            conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

            (( b. ))??
            effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
            consequential damages, such as lost profits; and

            (( c. ))??
            states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.

      (( B. ))??
      Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in
      the Program:

      Copyright (C) __20__.
      All Rights Reserved.

      (( C. ))??
      In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of
      its Contribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of
      its additions and/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that
      reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
      Contribution. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore,
   if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
   Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
   every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and
   costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
   actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
   extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in
   connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
   offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
   Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
   Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
   Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the
   defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
   may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If
   that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors
   related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
   any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor
   must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
   associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
   not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
   applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
   EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
   to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
   in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
   Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
   is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
   entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
   or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   //** <OWNER> **//
   __5__
   may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
   time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
   version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
   distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
   received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
   Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
   under the new version. No one other than
   //** <OWNER> **//
   __5__
   has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in
   Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
   intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
   expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program
   not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of
   //** <STATE> **//
   __5__
   and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
   to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
   one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a
   jury trial in any resulting litigation.

   GRANT OF RIGHTS

      (( a. ))??
      Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,

      patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.

      (( d. ))??

      Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this
      Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:

         (( a. || 1. ))??
         it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

         (( b. || 2. ))??
         if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a
         copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is
         included with each copy of the Program; and

         (( c. || 3. ))??
         if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license
         agreement:

            (( i. || a. ))??
            effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
            conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

            (( ii. || b. ))??
            effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
            consequential damages, such as lost profits; and

            (( iii. || c. ))??
            states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.

      (( B. ))??
      Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in
      the Program:

      Copyright (C) 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc. and others. All Rights
      Reserved.

      (( C. ))??
      In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of
      its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients
      to identify the originator of the Contribution. Also, each Contributor
      must agree that the additions and/or changes are intended to be a
      Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter be
      revoked.

   (( 4. ))??
   COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who
   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore,
   if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
   Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
   every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and
   costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
   actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
   extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in
   connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
   offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
   Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
   Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
   Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the
   defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
   may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If
   that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors
   related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
   any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor
   must pay those damages.

   (( 5. ))??
   NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks
   associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
   not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
   applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.

   (( 6. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
   CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
   ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
   EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   (( 7. ))??
   EXPORT CONTROL

   Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the
   United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws
   and regulation of any other countries).

   (( 8. ))??
   GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
   to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
   in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
   Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
   is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
   entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
   or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
   does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
   aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
   terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as
   soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
   Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
   continue and survive.

   LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from
   time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
   distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
   always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
   was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
   Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
   under the new version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this
   Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
   Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
   Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
   or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
   Agreement are reserved.

   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
   intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
   Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
   after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
   in any resulting litigation.

         or as part of a Larger Work; and

         (( (b) ))??
         under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
         Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the Original
         Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such
         patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original
         Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be
         necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

      (( 2.2. ))??
      Contributor Grant.

      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property

         Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

         (( (b) ))??
         under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to
         Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to

         to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to
         any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further
         Modifications or combinations.

   (( 3. ))??
   Distribution Obligations.

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
      on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
      of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
      include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims.

         If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
         right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under
         this License), you must include a text file with the source code
         distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party
         making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
         to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
         Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
         modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
         Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs.

         If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You
         own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that
         API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You
      describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one
      or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
      notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in
      a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your
      choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
      You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
      for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
      this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
      single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
   then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
   extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
   Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4
   and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions.

      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
      given a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other
      than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
      created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works.

      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "NPL" or any
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b)
      otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms
      which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
      (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
      Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves
      be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   (( 7. ))??
   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   (( 8. ))??
   TERMINATION.

   This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
   days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
   which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
   Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
   termination of this License shall survive.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
   SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do

   (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara
   County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any
   litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
   the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying
   in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for
   costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law
   or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section
   3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
   Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies
   of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing
   such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected
   parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

      limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
      this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
      hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
      additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which

      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
      months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been

      Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      (( 3.3. ))??

      contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create

      Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
      the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Intellectual Property Matters

         (( (a) ))??
         Third Party Claims

         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
         intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
         by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
         a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
         describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
         that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
         knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
         Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
         copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
         steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
         reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
         that new knowledge has been obtained.

         (( (b) ))??
         Contributor APIs

         If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
         interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
         reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
         include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (( c ))??
         Representations.

         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
         3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
         are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
         sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
      of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
      would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
      described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
      documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
      ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
      one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
      for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      (( 3.6. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
      Executable form only if the requirements of Sections
      (( 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 || 3.1 - 3.5 ))
      have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
      stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
      under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
      You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
      conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
      documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
      relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
      Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
      this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      (( 3.7. ))??
      Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
      other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
   Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
   notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   (( 6. ))??
   Versions of the License.

      (( 6.1. ))??
      New Versions

      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
      given a distinguishing version number.

      (( 6.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other
      than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
      created under this License.

      (( 6.3. ))??
      Derivative Works

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note
      that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
      clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from
      the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the
      name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice

   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
   COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
   OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
   THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
   THIS DISCLAIMER.

   Termination

      (( 8.1. ))??
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
      within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
      Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
      this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
      beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      (( 8.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
      such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (( a. ))??
         such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
         any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You
         under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
         notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60
         days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay
         Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
         such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
         parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
         terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
         above.

         (( b. ))??
         any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and
         2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      (( 8.3. ))??
      If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
      settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
      then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
      amount or value of any payment or license.

      (( 8.4. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
      shall survive termination.

   (( 9. ))??
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
   OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
   INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
   PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
   LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   (( 10. ))??
   U.S. government end users

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
   2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
   "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
   C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
   227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   (( 11. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
   its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
   Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
   California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
   drafter shall not apply to this License.

   (( 12. ))??
   Responsibility for claims

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
   admission of liability.

   (( 13. ))??
   Multiple-licensed code

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer

   Responsibilities

      (( 3.1. ))??
      Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code
      Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and
      how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter
      or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

      (( 3.2. ))??
      Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         (( (a) ))??
         such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
         of distribution to the recipient; and

         (( (b) ))??
         You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
         License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
         license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
         recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      (( 3.3. ))??
      Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
      the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
      Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License
      permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the
      terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger
      Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under
      the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

      (( 3.4. ))??
      Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
      (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
      Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
      extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      (( 3.5. ))??
      Application of Additional Terms

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
      jurisdiction.

   (( 4. ))??
   Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

   (( 5. ))??
   Termination

      (( 5.1. ))??
      The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
      basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
      some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
      compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
      reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
      non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
      received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor,
      and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the
      notice.

      (( 5.2. ))??
      If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1
      of this License shall terminate.

      (( 5.3. ))??
      In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
      termination shall survive termination.

   (( 6. ))??
   Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
   as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
   any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

   (( 7. ))??
   Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to
   You.

   (( 8. ))??
   Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   (( 9. ))??
   Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

   (( 10. ))??
   Versions of the License

      (( 10.1. ))??
      New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

      (( 10.2. ))??
      Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

      (( 10.3. ))??
      Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

      (( 10.4. ))??
      Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses

      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

(( Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based
products.

For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and
protection of investments in applications, software and people.

For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly
reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application
software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps
development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and
suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the
integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of
the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of
modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license
requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so
we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues
with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees). ))??

the Perl Programming Language. As significant differences exist, the complete
license should be read. ))??

(( PREAMBLE

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. ))??

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost,
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

   (( 1. ))??
   You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
   Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all
   of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

   (( 2. ))??
   You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in
   such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

   (( 3. ))??
   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
      equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
      such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
      modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

      (( b) ))??
      use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

      (( c) ))??
      rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
      standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
      manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
      differs from the Standard Version.

      (( d) ))??
      make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

   (( 4. ))??
   You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

      (( a) ))??
      distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
      together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
      get the Standard Version.

      (( b) ))??
      accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
      with your modifications.

      (( c) ))??
      accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
      Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard
      names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or
      equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
      Version.

This Open Software License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

Licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0

   (( 1) ))??
   Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to
   do the following:

      (( a) || 1 ))??
      to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
      collective work;

      (( b) || 2 ))??
      to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
      Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon
      the Original Work;

      (( c) || 3 ))??
      to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative
      Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
      Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed
      under this Open Software License;

      (( d) || 4 ))??
      to perform the Original Work publicly; and

      (( e) || 5 ))??
      to display the Original Work publicly.

   (( 2) ))??
   Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled
   by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the
   Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for
   sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

   (( 3) ))??
   Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form
   of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
   documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to
   provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
   with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor
   reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
   copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to
   permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
   continues to distribute the Original Work.

   (( 4) ))??
   Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
   of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
   service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
   Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as
   expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
   Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
   intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
   for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than
   the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the
   trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work.
   Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
   licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that
   Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

   (( 5) ))??
   External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
   distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in
   any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone
   other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those
   persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.
   As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat
   any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a
   distribution under section 1(c).

   (( 6) ))??
   Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
   Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the
   Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must
   cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
   prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that
   You have modified the Original Work.

   (( 7) ))??
   Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
   copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
   Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
   of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
   and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
   sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS"
   BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
   for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
   WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part
   of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License
   except under this disclaimer.

   (( 8) ))??
   Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
   Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
   the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
   of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
   apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

   (( 9) ))??
   Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this
   License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
   License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
   copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
   effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
   the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
   the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative
   Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms
   and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
   Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
   limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall
   terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
   granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in
   Section 1(c).

   (( 10) ))??
   Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and
   You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
   as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original
   Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an
   action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with
   other software or hardware.

   (( 11) ))??
   Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
   License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
   Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and
   under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
   The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
   Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
   subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
   appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 12) ))??
   Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
   seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
   recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
   attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
   any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

   (( 13) ))??
   Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
   such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable.

   (( 14) ))??
   Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
   in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising
   rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
   entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
   under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
   of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
   percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
   ownership of such entity.

   (( 15) ))??
   Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
   restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises
   not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

   (( 16) ))??
   Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (c) 2005 Lawrence
   Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License
   without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this
   License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You
   may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your
   modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original
   works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not
   indicate in any way that your Modified License is the "Open Software License"
   or "OSL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified
   License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph
   above with the notice "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or
   with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in
   this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
   source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source
   Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification
   process.
